# Tasks: GEDCOM Parser Library

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-gedcom-parser-library/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/interfaces.go (complete)

**Tests**: This project follows TDD approach with ‚â•85% test coverage requirement (per constitution). All test tasks must be completed BEFORE implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Note that User Story 4 (Version Conversion) has been deferred to future improvements.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Go library structure: packages at repository root
- Test files: `*_test.go` alongside source files
- Examples: `examples/` directory
- Test data: `testdata/` directory with GEDCOM sample files

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion (can run parallel to US1 if desired, but builds on US1 parser)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion (can run parallel to US1/US2, but validation needs parsed documents)
- **Encoding (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs parser and types)
- **Examples (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1, US3, and Encoding completion
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all previous phases completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - Required for: US2 (builds on parser), US3 (validates parsed docs), Encoding (writes parsed docs)

- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2)
  - Enhances: US1 parser with better error handling
  - Can be implemented independently but logically extends US1

- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2)
  - Requires: Parsed documents from US1
  - Independent validation logic, can be tested separately

### Within Each Phase

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Core types tasks (T008-T022) can all run in parallel
- Charset tasks (T023-T025) can run in parallel with core types
- All foundational tasks must complete before Phase 3

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- Tests (T026-T034) MUST be written FIRST and should FAIL
- Parser implementation (T035-T041) after tests written
- Version detection (T042-T046) can run parallel with parser
- Decoder (T047-T054) depends on Parser and Version completion
- Verification (T055-T061) runs after all implementation complete

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- Tests (T062-T067) MUST be written FIRST

- Implementation tasks (T108-T113) run sequentially
- Verification (T114-T117) runs after implementation

**Phase 7 (Examples)**:
- All example and documentation tasks (T118-T127) can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Implementation

```bash
# After tests are written and failing, launch parallel implementation:

# Version detection files can be created in parallel:
Task T042: "Define GEDCOM 5.5 tag list in version/v55.go"
Task T043: "Define GEDCOM 5.5.1 tag list in version/v551.go"
Task T044: "Define GEDCOM 7.0 tag list in version/v70.go"

# After parser is complete, these can run in parallel:
Task T047: "Create DecodeOptions struct in decoder/options.go"
Task T048: "Implement Decoder interface in decoder/decoder.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~1 day)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~2-3 days)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (~4-6 days)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently with all sample files
5. **MVP READY**: Can parse valid GEDCOM files from all three versions

**Timeline**: ~7-10 days for MVP
**Deliverable**: Functional GEDCOM parser library (parsing only, no validation yet)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): ~3-4 days ‚Üí Project structure ready
2. **MVP** (Phase 3): +4-6 days ‚Üí Can parse valid files ‚úÖ
3. **Error Handling** (Phase 4): +2-3 days ‚Üí Handles malformed files gracefully ‚úÖ
4. **Validation** (Phase 5): +3-5 days ‚Üí Validates against spec ‚úÖ
5. **Roundtrip** (Phase 6): +2-3 days ‚Üí Can write GEDCOM files ‚úÖ
6. **Examples** (Phase 7): +1-2 days ‚Üí Documentation and examples complete ‚úÖ
7. **Polish** (Phase 8): +1 day ‚Üí Ready for v0.1.0 release ‚úÖ

**Total Timeline**: ~16-24 days for complete library (aligns with plan.md estimate of 14-22 days)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational is done, split work**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - Core parsing
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Phase 4) - Error handling (can start tests in parallel)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Validation (can start defining rules early)
3. **After US1 complete**: Developer A picks up Encoding (Phase 6)
4. **Convergence**: All developers work on Examples and Polish together

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD Approach**: Constitution requires TDD - tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Must maintain ‚â•85% coverage at all times (constitution requirement)
- **Each user story**: Should be independently completable and testable
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate story independence before proceeding
- **Performance**: Verify benchmarks meet targets (SC-002, SC-003, SC-008)
- **No panics**: All error paths must return errors, never panic (FR-015)
- **User Story 4 deferred**: Version conversion moved to future improvements per plan.md simplification
