# Specification Quality Checklist: GEDCOM Parser Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED ✅

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

### Content Quality Analysis
- ✅ **No implementation details**: The spec avoids mentioning Go, specific libraries, or implementation approaches. It describes WHAT needs to be parsed, not HOW.
- ✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate developer needs and business value (parsing files, handling errors, validation, conversion).
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written from the perspective of library users (developers integrating the library), not implementers.
- ✅ **All mandatory sections present**: User Scenarios, Requirements (Functional + Key Entities), Success Criteria with Assumptions.

### Requirement Completeness Analysis
- ✅ **No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers**: All requirements are concrete. The specification makes informed decisions about scope (all official GEDCOM versions 5.5, 5.5.1, 7.0) and capabilities.
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 "parse GEDCOM 5.5, 5.5.1, 7.0" - test with sample files from each version).
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (5 lines of code, 10K records/sec, 100MB files, 95% error detection, etc.).
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria describe outcomes from user perspective without implementation details.
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios complete**: Each user story has 4-5 Given/When/Then scenarios covering key flows.
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering empty files, circular relationships, memory limits, encodings, etc.
- ✅ **Clear scope**: Library focuses on parsing, validation, and conversion for official GEDCOM versions. Boundaries are implicit (no editing UI, no cloud sync, etc.).
- ✅ **Assumptions documented**: 7 assumptions listed covering file formats, user knowledge, hardware, and typical usage patterns.

### Feature Readiness Analysis
- ✅ **Requirements linked to acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to scenarios in user stories (e.g., FR-001 covered by US1 scenarios 1-3).
- ✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: P1 (parse valid), P2 (handle errors), P3 (validate), P4 (convert) represent complete library lifecycle.
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria provide concrete targets for parsing performance, memory usage, error detection, and developer experience.
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec never mentions Go types, package structure, or technical architecture.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed from user
- All user stories are independently testable as designed
- Success criteria provide clear targets for implementation validation
