0 @N1@ NOTE This note tests CONT (continuation) which adds a newline.
1 CONT This is the second line after a CONT.
1 CONT This is the third line after another CONT.
1 CONT
1 CONT This line follows a blank CONT line.
0 @N2@ NOTE This note tests CONC (concatenation) which does NOT add a newline. This
1 CONC  text should be concatenated directly to the previous line without a line break.

0 @N3@ NOTE Mixed CONT and CONC test. This line has CONC text
1 CONC  concatenated immediately after it.

0 @N4@ NOTE Testing very long lines that exceed the GEDCOM recommended
1 CONC  255 character limit. According to the GEDCOM specification, lines
1 CONC  longer than 255 characters should be split using CONC tags. This
1 CONC  ensures compatibility with older systems that have line length
1 CONC  limitations. Here we test that the parser correctly reconstructs
1 CONC  the original text by concatenating all these fragments together
1 CONC  without introducing unwanted line breaks or spaces. The final
1 CONC  result should be one long continuous string of text.
